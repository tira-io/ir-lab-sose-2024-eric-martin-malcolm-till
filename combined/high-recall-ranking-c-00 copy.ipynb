    "This jupyter notebook serves as an improved retrieval system combining BM25, Query Expansion, and additional reranking models.\n",
    "We will use a corpus of scientific papers (title + abstracts) from the fields of information retrieval and natural language processing (the [IR Anthology](https://ir.webis.de/anthology/) and the [ACL Anthology](https://aclanthology.org/)). This notebook serves as a retrieval system, i.e., it gets a set of information needs (topics) and a corpus as input and produces a run file as output. Please do evaluations in a new dedicated notebook."
