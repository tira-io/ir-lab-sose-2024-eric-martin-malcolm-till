    "We will use the a corpus of scientific papers (title + abstracts) from the fields of information retrieval and natural language processing (the [IR Anthology](https://ir.webis.de/anthology/) and the [ACL Anthology](https://aclanthology.org/)). This serves Jupyter notebook only serves as retrieval system, i.e., it gets a set of information needs (topics) and a corpus as input and produces a run file as output. Please do evaluations in a new dedicated notebook."
